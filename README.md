## Version control system project

This repository contains a series of shell scripts which make up a version control system named 'gitr' (git restricted subset).
- The scripts will perform a subset of options available with git in the same expected way

This was a university assignment which I got 94/100

Skills gained:
- Deep understanding of git
- Shell programming and regex
- Shell argument/error handling

To use gitr, add the repository to your PATH
